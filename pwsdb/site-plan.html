      <h3>Cakes</h3>
      <p>
        We are happy to design a cake for any party. Let your imagination 
        go wild! Custom cakes are priced by size and level of decoration. 
        We can make you a birthday cake or a wedding cake. 
        Whether is your big day, rehearsal dinner, engagement party, or 
        shower, we have the most amazing and delicious cakes and treats for
        your celebrations. Customized with your choice of flavor, filling 
        and frosting. Our cakes are bakes entirely from scratch and hand 
        decorated in butter cream or fondant. 
        Our unique birthday and wedding cakes, including the hot trend of 
        birthday/wedding cakes with cupcakes, have become the choice of many
        clients. Cakes are available in traditional styles as well as 
        outrageous themes. The sky is the limit for your special day so make
        a statement.
        We offer stand rentals, delivery and/or set up throughout the Punto 
        Fijo area. We recommend one large cupcake or two-three mini cupcakes
        per guest. When selecting multiple flavors, you will want to increase
        the number a bit since many guests have been known to indulge in
        more than one  cupcake! Do not forget to order a cake for your 
        ceremonial cut.
        We offer complimentary tasting appointments for up to four guests. 
        Clients may select up to six flavors to sample and consultations 
        last 45-60min. To schedule an appointment email orders@dannisbakery.com.
